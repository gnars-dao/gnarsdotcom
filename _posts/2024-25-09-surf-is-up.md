João Parmagnani, a freesurfer and artist, funded by GnarsDAO, has crafted a unique [asymmetric Gnars surfboard](https://www.instagram.com/p/C-siVEWOYp1/?img_index=3) balso presenting upcycling and public goods in its project, with a premiere set. In the body of his proposal as an athlete, he weaves together Noggles Keychain upcycling—executed in partnership with [Precious Plastic ES](https://www.instagram.com/preciousplastic.es) and public goods initiatives at the [Comboios Biological Reserve](https://peakd.com/hive-141964/@joaoparmagnani/enpt-br-incredible-and-polluted-waves-sink-or-swin) into his project.

Additionally, Zimardrp launched a fashion line in collaboration with [Airdrop Culture](https://airdropculture.com.br/), [SurfGuru](https://surfguru.com.br/), and Gnars, with a distribution plan aimed at surfers and artists within the Gnars ecosystem.
