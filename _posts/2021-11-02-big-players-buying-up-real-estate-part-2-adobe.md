A couple of months ago, I wrote an article about [VISA buying a Crypto Punk avatar](/big-players-buying-up-real-estate-in-the-metaverse/). The primary point of the article is that ‘big players’, or simply big corporations, VISA in this case, plan to enter and play a significant role in the metaverse. There is a long list of other ‘big players’ getting into the metaverse; note Facebook’s recent name change to [Meta](https://qz.com/2081663/why-facebook-changed-its-name-to-meta/).

As the list of investments in the metaverse continues to grow, one-story really caught my eye. In recent news [Adobe](https://www.adobe.com/) announced that their software, such as [Photoshop](https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html) and [Illustrator](https://www.adobe.com/ca/products/illustrator.html) (all part of the [Creative Cloud](https://www.adobe.com/ca/creativecloud.html)), will soon come with an option to “[Prepare as NFT](https://news.bitcoin.com/adobe-jumps-into-non-fungible-token-ecosystem-with-prepare-as-nft-photoshop-tool/).” Adobe is very widely used globally; ‘‘[Adobe Photoshop](https://www.pixpa.com/blog/graphic-design-software) is arguably the most popular graphic design software with millions of artists around the world.” There is no doubt that a large portion of NFTs currently circulating were crafted with Adobe.

So what’s the big deal? So now there is a link that enables you to do something in one step that used to take multiple steps. The critical thing to consider is that Adobe Software is the most common software graphic design artists start on. We will see a generation of students wondering what is this “prepare as NFT” option? Even if their teacher has no clue what an NFT is. The “prepare as NFT” option will act as a portal to the metaverse for a new generation of artists.

The metaverse is quickly becoming something that new generations will take for granted. Like my generation takes the internet for granted, the metaverse will follow suit. It will meld into our daily lives until we can’t imagine life without it. Options to connect will begin to appear, little by little, click by click, the metaverse will become part of our lives.

In a way, this sounds intimidating, but it shouldn’t be as you can always log off or decide you don’t want to use the “prepare as NFT” option. The choice is yours, but the reality is that ignoring the metaverse is no longer a viable option for many corporations. If they do, many will perish. The list of investments will continue to grow exponentially as the gateway to the metaverse continues to expand.
