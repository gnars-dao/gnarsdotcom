One question we get asked a tonne is, “Do you listen to some podcasts which revolve around NFT, DAO, and Web3 topics?”. Of course! Podcasts are a great way to learn from like-minded individuals, as well as look at things from a different perspective. After all, our community is transitioning to the metaverse!

However, not all podcasts are worth your time. The type of content, quality of the show, or even the personality of the speakers are all factors to consider when choosing the perfect podcast.

So without further ado, here are the 14 podcasts I regularly tune in to. Maybe this list will help you find just the right one for you!

## PROOF

[PROOF](https://pod.link/1580998139) is a podcast starring American entrepreneur Kevin Rose — conducting high-quality interviews with emerging NFT artists. While Kevin usually invites inspiring NFT artists to his show, a mix of NFT project owners and DAO representatives occasionally get on to voice out their thoughts.

These interview-style podcast sessions usually last an hour, though the duration of the episode ranges from 45 to 90 minutes. Since its beginning on 10 March 2021 where PROOF uploads were irregular, the podcast has progressed into one that posts new episodes every 3 to 5 days.

If you’d like to listen in on a Q&amp;A-based, professional NFT podcast, PROOF may be the right one for you!

## Digitally Rare

[Digitally Rare](https://pod.link/1413304564) is a podcast with two friends (Matt Condon and Jonathan Mann) having fun conversations about the blockchain and beyond. The podcast invites a spicy mix of guests, such as NFT artists, big owners in the blockchain, and even skeptics of the space. Sometimes, it’s just Matt and Jonathan vibing with each other, along with the listeners of course!

The podcast is casual and lively, a lighthearted blockchain discussion would be the best way to put it. Each episode lasts for roughly an hour, and sometimes they get carried away to one-and-a-half hours. The duo has been doing this podcast for quite a while, debuting on 17 July 2018, but has taken month-long breaks from the show on certain occasions.  
For those interested in a fun and lively discussion of the blockchain, Digitally Rare is a decent pick! But take note that their posting schedule can be a little irregular!

## The NonFunGerbils Podcast

[The NonFunGerbils Podcast](https://pod.link/1476320911) is similar in style to the Digitally Rare podcast. In fact, they recently had a podcast episode together in September 2021. The NonFunGerbils Podcast is hosted by Luke and George, inviting different guests with a stake in the NFT community to have an interesting chat on how they’re involved in the space.

The podcasts have a laid-back style, sharing thoughts on NFT-related projects. The podcast started back on 12 August 2019, and they have been posting one to two times per month. The episode duration ranges anywhere from 30 to 90 minutes, depending on how much there is to talk about!

If you’ve finished all the episodes of Digitally Rare, perhaps the next one to gun for is The NonFunGerbils Podcast?

## Floor is Rising

[Floor is Rising](https://pod.link/1570037873) is a podcast hosted by NFT collector Sabretooth and professional art critic Kizu, delving into creating, collecting, and critiquing NFTs. This podcast invites various guests across the 3Cs (Creating, collecting, critiquing), and you can expect a flurry of arguments and truly unique perspectives from different groups.

Floor is Rising is filled with subjective questions, waiting for individuals to share conflicting opinions. They have been posting content since 30 May 2021, and new episodes are released once or twice a week. Each episode lasts around 30 minutes, so Floor is Rising is one of the podcasts on this list with shorter episode durations.

If you’re looking for a quick listen during your lunch break, Floor is Rising can be an interesting podcast worth your time.

## The Cutting Edge

[The Cutting Edge](https://pod.link/1584186353) is a podcast with gmoney covering all-things-NFT, discussing how NFT and culture connect. This podcast is a compilation of recorded clips from their earlier live show, featuring content from Twitter, interviews, as well as panel discussions. While the audio quality may be poor at times, the content from guests on the show is intriguing and worth the listen.

The tone of the podcast really depends on the guests they invite, and each episode can vary from mellowed-down speeches to all-out action and entertainment. The Cutting Edge started on 1 September 2021 and has a timely schedule of posting every Wednesday. Each episode lasts roughly 45 minutes to an hour, though there was one episode that extended to 90 minutes.

To those interested in the opinions of influential people in the NFT space, do give The Cutting Edge a try!

## NFT now Podcast

[NFT now Podcast](https://pod.link/1561616636) is hosted by a trio of co-founders, Sam Hysell, Alejandro Navia, and Matt Medved. The podcast covers NFT-related topics and invites “artists, collectors, and technologists” on the show to share more about their experiences. This panel-discussion-like podcast provides expertise on certain NFT fields and is an informative listen worth tuning in to.

NFT now Podcast debuted on 7 April 2021, and posts every Wednesday without fail (so far!).  
The episodes of this podcast have a duration of about 30 to 50 minutes, so everything moves quickly in this short span. With three hosts on the show, the NFT now Podcast is jam-packed with ideas and voices, keeping up a lively atmosphere.

If you’re looking for thoughtful opinions on the NFT space, NFT now Podcast is the right choice for you.

## On The Other Side

[On The Other Side](https://pod.link/1570685120) is a podcast by Chase Chapman, claiming to explore the intersection of society, culture, and crypto. More specifically, the podcast focuses on DAO and web3 topics, interviewing contributors, artists, investors, and more. Listening to the crypto journeys of these guests is one of the main parts of this show, and some of them are truly eye-opening.

On The Other Side started on 7 July 2021, and the podcast hosts episodes weekly. Each one lasts around 30 to 50 minutes, and I’d say the style is more one-on-one discussion-based. Chase and the guest will share their thoughts on DAOs, web3, and both of their impacts on society — which I find is a very meaningful way of conducting a discussion.

Here’s our first DAO and web3 podcast on this list, so DAO fans should add On The Other Side to their watchlist. (Or listen-list?)

## NFTs WTF!

[NFTs WTF](https://pod.link/1565322645) is a podcast hosted by Jamie Burke (founder of Outlier Ventures), which covers pivotal moments in the NFT industry. The podcast is an interview-style listen, with distinguished guests sharing about their contributions towards the future of NFTs and the metaverse. Anything meaningful or impactful in the NFT arena will end up on this podcast.

NFTs WTF was first launched on 28 April 2021, and they used to post multiple episodes all on one day. Now, the schedule is fixed with weekly posts. Each episode lasts only 20 minutes, bite-sized audio even the busiest people can make time for. NFTs WTF is hosted in a Q&amp;A interview style, so you’re listening to the guests’ opinions on certain NFT incidents.

If you’re a busy person (I’m sure most of you are!), then NFTs WTF! is the podcast for you.

## Zima Red

[Zima Red](https://pod.link/1494165748) is a podcast starring Andrew Steinwold, an angel investor and thought leader in the NFT space. The podcast invites a host of guests, from creatives to users to founders, all exploring the NFT and digital art space. This interview-style podcast is a one-on-one conversation between Andrew and established guests, so there are lots to learn from the podcast.

Zima Red was first launched back on 19 December 2019 and has an irregular posting schedule across their 89 episodes so far. Each episode duration is around an hour, plus-minus fifteen minutes. They have a pretty standard professional tone at Zima Red, allowing for a clean-cut interview with guests.

Mint hosts podcast episodes similar to PROOF, inviting guests and having one-on-one interviews with them. Mint is currently on Season 3 of their podcast, and they still have a long run ahead!

Mint debuted on 8 July 2021, and they host podcast episodes a few times per week. Each episode runs for around 30 minutes to an hour, depending on how in-depth they go into a topic. The discussions are Q&amp;A-based, so it is extremely informative for listeners looking for opinions in the space.

As one of the only web3 focused podcasts on this list, you should definitely have a listen to what this podcast has to offer.
